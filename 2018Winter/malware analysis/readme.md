## IOT malware: samples and analysis
```

Linux/Hydra is the earliest known malware targeting IoT devices. 
It is an open source botnet framework released in 2008. 
It was designed for extensibility and features both a spreading mechanism and DDoS functionality.

LightAidra/Aidra is a IRC-based mass scanning and exploitation tool support on several architectures, 
namely MIPS, MIPSSEL, ARM, PPC, x86/86-64 and SuperH. Malware is designed to search open telnet ports that could be accessed 
using known default credentials. The source code of LightAidra is freely available on the Internet as open source project.

Linux.Wifatch is an open-source malware which infects the IoT devices with weak or default credentials. 
Once infected, it removes other malwares and disables telnet access while logging the message "Telnet 
has been closed to avoid further infection of theis device. Please disable telnet, change telnet passwords, 
and/or update the firmware." in the device logs. 

Wifatch uses peer-to-peer network to update the malware definition 
and deletes remnants of malware which remain in the IoT devices.

### IOT malware:BASHLIFE/Lizkebab/Torlus/gafgyt
```
BASHLIFE/Lizkebab/Torlus/gafgyt is one of the popular malware which infects Linux based IoT devices to launch DDoS attacks. 
It was reported that BASHLIFE is responsible for enslaving over 1 million IoT devices, 
constituting mostly of Internet enabled cameras and DVRs. It is capable of launching attack of up to 400 Gpbs. 
Most BASHLIFE attacks are simple UDP, TCP floods and HTTP attacks. 
BASHLIFE infect a IoT device by brute-forcing its telnet access using known default credentials. 
One interesting aspect of BASHLIFE is that malware payload deployed in IoT devices has the BASHLIFE's C2s IP addresses hard-coded into it 
and are easier to monitor. Most of the infected devices are located in Taiwan, Brazil and Columbia. 
The source code of BASHLIFE was partly leaked in early 2015 and has led to many variants. 
BASHLIFE is considered the predecessor of Mirai and is in direct competition for vulnerable IoT real estate.
```
### IOT malware:Mirai
```
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirai_(malware)
Mirai is one of the most predominant DDoS IoT botnet in recent times. Mirai means "the future" in Janpanese. 
Mirai botnet is definitely the next step in IoT DDoS malwares, however not as sophisticated as Remaiten but most effective. 
Mirai botnet is famous for being used in the record breaking 1.1Tbps DDoS attack with 148000 IoT devices. 
Mirai targets mostly CCTV cameras, DVRs, and hoem routers. Since the release of the Mirai source code, 
the number of IoT infected devices has increased from 213000 to 483000 in just two weeks. 
Mirai generates floods of GRE IP, GRE ETH, SYN and ACK, STOMP, DNS, UDP, or HTTP traffic against a target during a DDoS attack. 
More recently, Mirai has been found to be enhanced to infect Windows devices, helping hackers hijack even more devices. 
This enhanced Mirai could also identify and compromise database services like MySQL and Microsoft SQL running on different ports 
to create new admin "phpminds" with the password "phpgodwith" allowing the hackers to steal the database. 
The awareness of IoT botnets in recent times attributes to Mirai and the volume of traffic generated during its DDoS attacks.
